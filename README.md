# WVS-sexism-ML
This repository stores a project about predictors of sexism around the world. I used the 6th wave of the World Value Survey.

** NOTE: The caption under the map plot says "the brigher a coutnry is colored, the less sexist its people are on average." This should be the reverse: "the darker a country is colored, the less sexist its people are on average."
